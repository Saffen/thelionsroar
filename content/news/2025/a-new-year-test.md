The lamps along the Trade District were lit early this evening, not out of necessity,
but out of habit. Guards reported no disturbances, merchants closed on time, and even
the gryphon roosts were quieter than usual.

Whether this calm marks the beginning of a peaceful winter stretch, or merely the pause
before something louder, remains to be seen.
